Accuracy	Power Usage	Technology
20ft	High	Autonomous GPS, Provider: gps
uses GPS chip on the device
line of sight to the satellites
need about 7 to get a fix
takes a long time to get a fix
doesn’t work around tall buildings
200ft	Medium – Low	Assisted GPS (AGPS), Provider: network
uses GPS chip on device, as well as assistance from the network (cellular network) to provide a fast initial fix
very low power consumption
very accurate
works without any line of sight to the sky
depends on carrier and phone supporting this (even if phone supports it, and network does not then this does not work)
5300ft / 1mile	Low	CellID lookup/WiFi MACID lookup, Provider: network or passive
very fast lock, and does not require GPS chip on device to be active
requires no extra power at all
has very low accuracy; sometimes can have better accuracy in populated and well mapped areas that have a lot of WiFi access points, and people who share their location with Google
